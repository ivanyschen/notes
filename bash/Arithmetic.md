# Arithmetic

## let

```bash
let <arithmetic expression>
```

- Keep in mind that bash is space-sensitive. `let a=5+10` is **not** the same as `a = 5 + 10`

## expr

```bash
expr <item_1> <operator> <item_2>
```

- If quotes are put around the expression, then the expression will not be evaluated but printed out straight.
