A: Yes  
  
Q: How to use flask migration on the existing database?  
A:  
Key:  
- Flask-migrate compares the difference between models in the flask project and what it is in the database that the flask project points to, and create migration files. Therefore, we have to trick flask-migrate into thinking that the existing database is empty by pointing to a temperory database.  

- Run `flask db stamp head` instead of `flask db upgrade`
