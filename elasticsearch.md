# Elasticsearch

- What is the difference between `properties` and `fields`?  
	If a `.foo` is defined as a `property`, `.foo` will be created as an index indexed during indexing time. On the other hand, `fields` are defined to tell ES how you want it to analyze the parental entity as defined in the `fields`.
